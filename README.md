# Laravel Authentication Service CodeTest

This project was developed as a recruitment exercise for Patricia.

The Laravel Authentication Service is an implementation of OAuth2 server authentication for your laravel api application. APIs typically use tokens to authenticate users and do not maintain session state between requests. This service uses Laravel Passport which provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for your Laravel application.
